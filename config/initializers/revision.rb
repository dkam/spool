# The Dockerfile writes VERSION at build time from a --build-arg GIT_SHA.
# Outside a container there is no such file, so fall back to asking git — but
# only in development, because shelling out on boot is not something a deployed
# container should do, and it has a VERSION file anyway.
#
# See config/version.rb for why this is a separate thing from Spool::VERSION.
